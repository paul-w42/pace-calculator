# Pace Calculator

## Application

This is a small PWA application that allows the user to solve for various values and perform what-ifs with respect to pace, distance, and time.

It is not yet feature complete, but the basics are here.

This is a PWA, and it should be possible to install locally to a device.


## Development

This app is currently developed with Svelte 5.x and Typescript. It uses a [svelte/store](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/svelte-store) to hold the basic information used to solve the pace problem, and this is accessed by each of the separate components. There are basic components for each of **Pace**, **Distance**, and **Time**.



## Backlog

- Clear All button
- Save Calculation button
  - save the current calculation to a list at the bottom of the screen for later use/comparison
